## Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website built with Django. It is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and provide an easy way for visitors or potential employers to contact me. The site features a modern, responsive design using JavaScript, Vanilla CSS, Bootstrap 5, a theme switcher (light/dark mode), and dynamic project and contact sections. The codebase is structured for easy maintenance and future enhancements, making it both a professional presence and a playground for learning and experimenting with new technologies.


### Project Goals

- **To showcase Skills & Projects:**  
  Present my development skills, technologies, and completed projects in a visually appealing and organized way.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Ensure the portfolio is fully responsive and accessible on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

- **Easy Contact:**  
  Provide a simple and secure way for visitors to contact me via a form, with email notifications. Alternatively, via social networks.

- **Modern UI/UX:**  
  Use Bootstrap 5 design principles, and interactive elements (like theme switching) for a professional look and feel.

- **Maintainability:**  
  Structure the codebase for easy updates, scalability, and future enhancements using Django best practices.

- **Learning & Experimentation:**  
  Serve as a platform to experiment with new technologies, Django features, back-end techniques, testing and AI tools.

- **Professional Presence:**  
  Offer a central, up-to-date place for recruiters and collaborators to learn about me and my work.

## What I Learned

- How to configure Email, using google SendEmails API.
- The importance of saving theme preference in localStorage for a consistent user experience. - If theme is not stored in local storage the chosen theme is not kept - it switches on the click of page load.
- Managing content dynamically and leverage Django’s features: Django’s ORM (querying, relationships, admin editing), for scalable projects.
- Using `RichTextField` for flexible content editing.
- djhtml: For consistent django template (djhtml .)/ (djhtml template name)
